# Open-Woodwind-Project

The Open Woodwind Project is an opensource woodwind controller based on the Teensy, MPR121, and BNO055 IMU. 

OWP_Synth is a sub project utilizing a Teensy Audio Libray based multi oscillator with LFOs, waveshaping, effects, and a complex modulation scheme, controlled over an OSC iPad interface. It will eventually be fully integrated into the onboard synth for the controller.  


See https://hackaday.io/project/2992-the-open-woodwind-project for porject log information.

I'll be including source code, and the 3D printing files necessary to reproduce this project in full here.
