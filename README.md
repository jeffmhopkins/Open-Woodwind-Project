# Open-Woodwind-Project

The Open Woodwind Project is aimed at making an open source MIDI Woodwind Controller with onboard synthesizer.

It utilizes a Teensy microcontroller with Audio Breakoout, two MPR121s,BNO055 IMU, and MPXV4006GP pressure Transducer. 

OWP_Synth is a sub project utilizing a Teensy Audio Libray based multi oscillator with LFOs, waveshaping, effects, and a complex modulation scheme, controlled over an OSC iPad interface. It will eventually be fully integrated into the onboard synth for the controller.  

There are configuration files for an OSC interface for the OWP_Synth that runs on a Raspberry Pi.

See https://hackaday.io/project/2992-the-open-woodwind-project for porject log information.

I'll be including source code, and the 3D printing files necessary to reproduce this project in full here.
