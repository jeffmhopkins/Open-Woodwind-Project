Files for a box to hold the Teensy 4.0 + Audio Boad Rev D

Notes:
* The Teensy is meant to be soldered directly to the top of the audio board, using male pin headers. One of the capacitors on the Teensy comes VERY close to the SD card slot. Insulate the top of the SD card slot with kapton tape to avoid shorting.
* The Audio board is secured to the box with three 6mm M3 screws. The board fits TIGHT to the interior of the box. You have to insert the USB and headphone jack, and press fit it down into the box.
* If the board is too tight, you may have to inset the model in your slicer (My printer and your printer are likely a little different)
* The bumper is meant to be printed with the modeled supports in TPU. The modeled supports have a 0.3mm gap, which when you slice should be a ONE LAYER gap. adjust your settings to make this true, and your supports will come out great.
